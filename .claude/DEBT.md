## Directories Project

- **High**: 187 imported businesses have fabricated/placeholder data (all show `"products": ["business-cards"]` as default — not real capabilities)
- **High**: 336/348 scraped businesses missing website URLs — Crawl4AI enrichment blocked until URLs found
- **Medium**: Bonn & Sindelfingen have no real data (template only) — zero SEO value currently
- **Medium**: Schema markup gaps — FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, ItemList missing from comparison/category pages

## Setup

- **Medium**: /install multi-app flow untested on real business — needs validation with Printulu or Bonn Gastro folder structure
- **Low**: Brand guides are visual/design only — business CLAUDE.md template needs domain-level content (entities, API contracts) that brand guides don't cover
