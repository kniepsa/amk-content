# NEXT - Task Queue

## Current Focus

_No active task. Run /warmup to start._

## Backlog

- [ ] Test /install multi-app flow on a real business (Printulu or Bonn Gastro)
- [ ] Update README.md to reflect current V3 structure
- [ ] Sync new gotchas from vibe-coding-setup/CLAUDE.md → ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (4 new: context 70%, .claudeignore, two-correction rule, interview pattern)
- [ ] Try /worktree command on a real feature (validate the Boris Cherny parallel worktree pattern — `claude --worktree` is now a native flag in v2.1.49)
- [ ] Explore Docker Sandboxes for Claude Code isolation (Docker Desktop 4.50 feature — container with workspace mounted at same absolute path)
- [ ] Explore LSP tool in Claude Code for go-to-definition, find references, hover docs (new code intelligence)
