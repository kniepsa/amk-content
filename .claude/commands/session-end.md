# Session End (amk-content)

This extends the global /session-end with content-specific tasks.

## 1. Run Global Session End First
Complete all standard session-end tasks (CLAUDE.md, DEBT.md, NEXT.md, ADRs).

## 2. Claude Code Feature Discovery
Research ONE new Claude Code feature or improvement:

**Search topics** (rotate through these):
- "Claude Code new features 2025"
- "Claude Code MCP servers"
- "awesome-claude-code github"
- "Claude Code tips tricks"
- "Claude Code hooks"
- "Claude Code skills"

**If you find something useful**:
- Add to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` if it's a workflow improvement
- Create new command in `~/.claude/commands/` if it's a new capability
- Create skill in `~/.claude/skills/` if appropriate
- Add to `vibe-coding-setup/NEXT.md` as improvement todo

**Output format**:
```
Claude Code Discovery:
- Topic searched: [what you searched]
- Finding: [one-liner about what you found]
- Action taken: [added to X / created Y / noted for later]
```

## 3. Sync Check
Remind: "Run /sync-vibe-setup if you made changes to ~/.claude/ configs."

## 4. Content Pipeline Check
- Any new ideas added to articles/ideas.md?
- Any ideas ready to become drafts?
