## Vibe Coding Setup

My personal Claude Code configuration for AI-assisted development. See [vibe-coding-setup/README.md](./vibe-coding-setup/README.md).

Highlights:
- One-command project entry with full context
- Task tracking with `/next`
- One-command deploy with `/ship`
- Visual regression testing
- Notion integration for rocks/tasks
